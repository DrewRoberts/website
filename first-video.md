## There are a 1,000 ways to build a website, do your thing

- Don't let the need for perfection be what holds you back from launching

- Stand on the shoulders of those that came before you
- Pay it forward with either a contribution to open source code or a contribution of ideas/content
- Contribute something valuable to the interwebs that only you can provide
- Snowball effect if you keep this on point for your brand to build the identity

## Embrace the concept of Art Constraints

- Embrace the medium and what it can do and can't do. Then set additional constraints on your application
- Constraints not restraints
- "Within a constraint, within a limitation, is infinite freedom."

## Distribution of Content

- Most important thing is to consider how you're going to distribute your content
- Play the game, follow the rules, which are set by Google & Facebook.
- If you want to know what distribution options are available to you, Traction by Gabriel Weinberg provides a helpful framework and will give you the terminology to dive deeper on the ones that apply to your website
- I base most of my website decisions on core SEO principles
### Growth Hacks

## Good Style Helps Clear Communication

### Tactical Strategy
- Should only have one primary call to action
- What is your call and what's the best CTA?

## Automate everything

- Think about your process for adding content to the website and free your time to be creative not do busy work
- After you automate testing, your confidence in the code increases
- Continuous Integration

## Consistency Wins

- Seth Godin and seths.blog
- Just show up. Read Steven Pressfield if you need a kick in the pants.
- Everybody Writes by Ann Handley
- Josh Waitzkin also good on this topic. He references Hemmingway ended the day with something left to do.

## Analytics

- Measure what Matters by John Doerr
- Continual Iteration
- Quote about how a company is able to learn by number of tests they are able to do

## Commit to lifelong learning

- The web is a trendy place, keep an eye on the trendsetters and where things are heading
- Wes Bos, Jeffrey Way, all Google Developer Advocates, and web conference talks are better than college
- Plenty of resources like Treehouse, Udacity, and Udemy, so no excuses
- Start here: "My top 5 web conference talks as of right now" will be next video in this series

## My two cents

- Markdown everything
- AMP as a web framework (Paul Baukus even makes a pitch in Japanese)
- Laravel if you need a backend (Taylor Otwell & that community will make you a web artisan. Tighten is amazing.)
- Burn the trailing backslashes and www
- I prefer server rendered sites over javascript SPA
- Serverless is even better
- Web components could be a game changer
- 5G is definately a game changer similar to iphone
- Google Domains will reduce friction in your life
