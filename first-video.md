# Thoughts & Resources for Your Website

- Want some thoughts to consider for your website? I also have some resources to recommend and will throw those links in the show notes.
- I'm a marketing guy who enjoys web development. I have a few friends launching websites, so I figured it would be best to consolidate my 2 cents for them into short video clips
- I'm basically scratching my own itch so I could just text them a link
- Hopefully some other people find this helpful
- Maybe I should use Tim Ferriss & Ramit Sethi style title when posting to YouTube

- Don't say: Most of my videos are private/unlisted but I'm willing to make this public cause it could be helpful for other folks
- Don't say, just post on screen: Feel free to share if you think it would be useful for anyone you know. MIT license.
- Don't say these, just show the clickbait titles on Buzzfeed, Forbes, etc: "Required Reading: 10 Considerations Before Launching Website" "7 Shocking Things You Must Know If You Have a Website!!!"

## There are a 1,000 ways to build a website, do your thing

- Don't let the need for perfection be what holds you back from launching
- Feel free to move fast & break things
- Concept of iteration key to this medium. Organic/transient in nature
- Think about input/output concept. Elon Musk articulates this best as communication interface with pictures, thumbs, etc. Internet just a better medium for increasing bandwidth and communication with others, join the organism

## Open Source is a gift to mankind

- Just accept the gift
- Hundreds of thousands of hours are devoted to some of these projects and you get to download that work for free and use however you want. It will blow your mind if you think about it.
- Stand on the shoulders of those that came before you

## Embrace the concept of Art Constraints

- Embrace the medium and what it can do and can't do. Then set additional constraints on your application
- Constraints not restraints
- "Within a constraint, within a limitation, is infinite freedom."

## Distribution of Content

- Most important thing is to consider how you're going to distribute your content
- Play the game, follow the rules, which are set by Google & Facebook.
- If you want to know what distribution options are available to you, Traction by Gabriel Weinberg provides a helpful framework and will give you the terminology to dive deeper on the ones that apply to your website
- I base most of my website decisions on core SEO principles

## Growth Hacks

- If you have not never heard of growth hacking, listen on Audible to Ryan Holiday's quick intro
- Sean Ellis goes into more depth with his Hacking Growth book
- Reforge by Brian Balfour & Andrew Chen is the best resource I've found. Good ROI for me.

## Know Your Tools

- Google Webmasters
- Moz or Ahrefs
- EDI, your code editor. I use VSCode 'cause John Papa
- Don't be scared of the command line. Hyper from Zeit will change your world

## Call To Action

- Should only have one primary call to action
- What is your call and what's the best CTA?

## What can you give for free?

- Contribute something valuable to the interwebs that only you can provide
- Keep this on point for your brand to build the identity
- Give it for free as a resource to begin the relationship with your visitor
- Aspire to be like Jason Fried and DHH. What a legacy to leave on the world!

## Be memorable, short dot com makes that easier

- Ma.tt is the exception, but anything he does is awesome

## Power of the Web

- Unrivaled distribution system in the history of mankind
- Really is amazing when you think about it. Try explaining to somebody who lived 100 years ago. Jeremiah's comedian clip

## Version control is your best friend

- Meet GitHub (show my profile)
- Learn the basic of git (gettinggit.com)
- Think in Packages. If you're into php, Marcel Pociot is your guy

## Minimum Viable Product

- Keep things simple, add to them only when you need it

## Make Good Art

- Neil Gaiman commencement is the perfect way to start your project

## Feel free to imitate

- Naval says creativity is merging two different concepts, so take something you like and apply it to your field

## But be authentic

- Look at Joe Rogan

## Speed Matters!

- Aspire to be like Addy Osmani & Paul Irish
- Google Lighthouse

## Automate everything

- Think about your process for adding content to the website and free your time to be creative not do busy work

## Consistency Wins

- Seth Godin and seths.blog
- Just show up. Read Steven Pressfield if you need a kick in the pants.
- Josh Waitzkin also good on this topic. He references Hemmingway ended the day with something left to do.

## SVG is amazing

- Google Sarah Drasner & Sara Soueidan

## Commit to lifelong learning

- The web is a trendy place, keep an eye on the trendsetters and where things are heading
- Wes Bos, Jeffrey Way, all Google Developer Advocates, and web conference talks are better than college
- Plenty of resources like Treehouse, Udacity, and Udemy, so no excuses
- Start here: "My top 5 web conference talks as of right now" will be next video in this series

## My two cents

- Markdown everything
- AMP as a web framework (Paul Baukus even makes a pitch in Japanese)
- Laravel if you need a backend (Taylor Otwell & that community will make you a web artisan. Tighten is amazing.)
- Burn the trailing backslashes and www
- I prefer server rendered sites over javascript SPA
- Web components could be a game changer
- 5G is definately a game changer similar to iphone
- Google Domains will reduce friction in your life
