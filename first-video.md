# Thoughts & Resources for Your Website

- I'm a marketing guy who enjoys web development, so here are some thoughts on how I approach launching a website
- Why am I making this video? Have a number of friends launching websites, so figured it would be best to consolidate my 2 cents into a few quick videos so I could text them a link
- Most of my videos are private/unlisted but I'm willing to make this public cause it could be helpful for folks
- Feel free to share if you think it would be useful for anyone you know

- Before we get into it, I thought about being like Tim Ferriss & Ramit Sethi and here are my best clickbait optional titles: "Required Reading: 10 Considerations Before Launching Website" "7 Shocking Things You Must Know If You Have a Website!!!"

## There are a 1,000 ways to build a site, do your thing

- Don't let the need for perfection be what holds you back from launching
- Feel free to move fast & break things
- Concept of iteration key to this medium. Organic/transient in nature
- Think about input/output concept. Elon Musk articulates this best as communication interface with pictures, thumbs, etc. Internet just a better medium for increasing bandwidth and communication with others, join the organism

## Embrace the concept of Art Constraints

- Embrace the medium and what it can do and can't do. Then set additional constraints on your application
- Constraints not restraints

## Distribution of Content

- Most important thing is to consider how you're going to distribute your content
- Play the game, follow the rules, which are set by Google & Facebook.
- Most website decisions based on core SEO principles

## Know Your Tools

- Google Webmasters
- Moz or Ahrefs
- EDI, your code editor. I use VSCode 'cause John Papa
- Don't be scared of the command line. Hyper from Zeit will change your world

## Call To Action

- Should only have one primary call to action
- What is your call and what's the best CTA?

## What can you give for free?

- Contribute something valuable to the interwebs that only you can provide
- Keep this on point for your brand to build the identity
- Give it for free as a resource to begin the relationship with your visitor
- Aspire to be like Jason Fried and DHH. What a legacy to leave on the world!

## Be memorable, short dot com makes that easier

- Ma.tt is the exception, but anything he does is awesome

## Power of the Web

- Unrivaled distribution system in the history of mankind
- Really is amazing when you think about it. Try explaining to somebody who lived 100 years ago. Jeremiah's comedian clip

## Version control is your best friend

- Meet GitHub
- Learn the basic of git (gettinggit.com)
- Think in Packages. If you're into php, Marcel Pociot is your guy

## Minimum Viable Product

- Keep things simple, add to them only when you need it

## Make Good Art

- Neil Gaiman commencement is the perfect way to start your project

## Feel free to imitate

- Naval says creativity is merging two different concepts, so take something you like and apply it to your field

## But be authentic

- Look at Joe Rogan

## Speed Matters!

- Aspire to be like Addy Osmani & Paul Irish
- Google Lighthouse

## Automate everything

- Think about your process for adding content to the website and free your time to be creative not do busy work

## Consistency Wins

- Seth Godin and seths.blog

## SVG is amazing

- Google Sarah Drasner & Sara Soueidan

## Commit to lifelong learning

- The web is a trendy place, keep an eye on the trendsetters and where things are heading
- Wes Bos, Jeffrey Way, all Google Developer Advocates, and web conference talks are better than college
- Plenty of resources like Treehouse, Udacity, and Udemy, so no excuses
- Start here: My top 5 web conference talks as of right now

## My two cents

- Open Source is the real bomb.com
- Markdown everything
- AMP as a web framework (Paul Baukus even makes a pitch in Japanese)
- Laravel if you need a backend (Taylor Otwell & that community are a gift to mankind. Tighten is amazing.)
- Burn the trailing backslashes and www
- Google Domains will reduce friction in your life
